# PROJECT TITLE 
EuroSAT Image Classification Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
A CNN model has been trained to classify land use types appearing in 10,000 test images of the EuroSAT database.

## DATA
The data used is the EUROSAT database. References are provided below.

## MODEL 
The model is a CNN due to the strength of these neural networks in image analysis.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
Hyperparameters have been chosen based upon author judgement or the defaults used in the Torch library.

## RESULTS
The model achieved an accuracy of 97% on 10,000 test images.
