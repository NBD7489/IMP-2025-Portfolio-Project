# Datasheet - EuroSAT

This datasheet describes the EuroSAT database developed for land use image classification. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/phelber/eurosat [Accessed: 10/06/2025]

## Motivation
The dataset was assembled by Helber et al. in 2015 to provide a dataset for AI land classification. Their work is described in their paper, cited below.

Helber et al. 2015. EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.
 
## Composition
The dataset is made up of 27,000 labelled satellite images.

There are 10 classes: Industrial Buildings; Residential Buildings; Annual Crop; Permanent Crop; River; Sea & Lake; Herbaceous Vegetation; Highway; Pasture and Forest.

The images measure 64 x 64 pixels.

## Collection process
The dataset was aquired from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
The dataset has been labelled.
 
## Uses
The dataset has been collected for use in land use classification tasks.

## Distribution
The dataset is publically distributed on GitHub. Citations for the dataset are provided below.
